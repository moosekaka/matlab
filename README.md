## matlab
This repository contains several matlab script files I have accumulated over the years. An interesting one is the `cell_boundary` folder which contains scripts that automatically segments the cell boundaries of yeast cells.

To run it, run `cell_boundary.m` and navigate to the folder containing the test image. The folder includes a test image which you should see the results of the segmentation as below.

<img src="./cell_boundary/input.png" style="float: left; width: 30%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">

<img src="./cell_boundary/output.png" style="float: left; width: 30%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
<p style="clear: both;">
